# Glossary

Library of functions which allow for the easy creation of hybrid, comparitive glossaries. This is a work-in-progress and therefore should only be used with extreme caution :)

## Release Names
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

I've decided to move away from the Greek derived naming conventions that are so prevalent in the software industry. I think it's much more fun to use the growth phases of a tree. Here's what to expect to see in this project's tags:

  1. v0.0-sprout - Initial growth phase. Highly eratic and unstable. Shapes change sporadically and without notice.
  2. v0.0-seedling - The basic shapes of the project are startign to form.
  3. v0.0-sapling - The stage before maturity. At least some sense of stability exists
